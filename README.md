# \<polymer-fx\>

**PolymerFx** is an extremely low-footprint framework based on polymer 2.x and webcomponents. Polymer already has most of the
characteristics of a modern web application framework. However, in order to make a full featured web app that does more than offline
interactions, a well defined structure is crucial. **PolymerFx** is built to provide that.

**PolymerFx** Gives you routing, navigation, page-switching, dialog, toasts, service/provider pattern, http rquests and many commonly used computed functions.

## Install using bower

```
bower install polymer-fx --save
```

## Concepts/Paradigm already covered in Polymer / v1 webcomponents specs

* Html imports
* Webcomponents
* Templating
* 2 way data binding
* Iteration and condition in templates

## Concepts/Paradigms covered in PolymerFx

* Clear distinction of **app**, **pages** and **views**
* Client side routing
* Navigation and page management
* HTTP requests
* Modal dialog APIs
* Commonly used computed functions
* Elaborate mixin system
* Custom templates in mixins
* Utility method (i.e. forced re-evaluation)

## Status of the project.

The library is in used by internal projects for [Lipi for Business](lipi.live). 

However, since Polymer 3.x took a divergent path from Polymer 2.x, pursuing this project further has no merit. If you are still interested, the [Unfinished docs](docs) are a good place to start.
