# \<polymer-fx\>

**PolymerFx** is an extremely low-footprint, yet full-blown framework based on polymer and webcomponents. Polymer already has most of the
characteristics of a modern web application framework. However, in order to make a full featured web app that does more than offline
interactions, a well defined structure is needed. **PolymerFx** is built to provide that.

**PolymerFx** Gives you *well documented* routing, navigation, page-switching, dialog, toasts, service patterns, http rquests and many commonly used computed functions.

## Install using bower

```
bower install polymer-fx --save
```

## Start coding

[Read the docs](docs) then jump into development with the [modified polymer starter kit](example/starter).
